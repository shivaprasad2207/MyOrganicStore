Organic promotes green planet. Importantly, genetically modified organisms are not allowed in organic agriculture.</span>
Organic farming strictly limits the use of artificial chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Antibiotics for animals are kept to an absolute minimum. Instead it emphasizes farming methods such as crop rotation to keep the soil healthy and natural pest-control systems.</span>

<li><strong>Prevent Water Contamination:</strong>Pesticides and chemo-synthetic fertilizers used in conventional farming are estimated to pollute the primary sources of drinking water to 60-70% of the country&#8217;s population. Organic farming prevents water contamination.</span></li>
<li><strong>Preserve Diversity:</strong>Loss of large variety of species (biodiversity) is a result of one crop being produced on the same soil year after year. Organic farming counteracts the loss</span></li>
